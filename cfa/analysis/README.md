# Data Preparation and Initial Analysis

Responses to the CFA are recorded in an Excel sheet, but need to be arranged in a specific format in order to calculate Semantic Distance.

Semantic Distance can be calculated for the first response, last response, and across the whole chain (chain score). Additionally, the measure of forward flow can be calculated as well.

More detailed instructions are contained in the R code itself. Please have a look at "0_cfa_analysis.R", which is the starting point for the analysis. The other three files are automatically imported into this file and deal with different aspects of analysis.
