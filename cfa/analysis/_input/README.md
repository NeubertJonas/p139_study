# Data Input

From the Excel file with raw responses, export csv files, one per seed word.
Follow this column scheme: Participant, Session, 1, 2, ..., n (responses)
Please make sure no additional columns/data are present.

Name the csv files based on the seed word: snow.csv, candle.csv, etc.

The csv file you will download from SemDis for calculating the chain score also goes here and should be named "chain_responses_SemDis.csv".
