# Experimental Code

Contains experimental Python scripts, which are not required to prepare the paper questionnaires.
One code tries to correct already printed questionnaires with a new date, but currently the text does not align properly. 
The other was used to add the standardized header to questionnaires designed in Adobe InDesign.
